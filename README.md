# Gmail Dot Alias Generator

This Python script generates dot aliases for Gmail addresses, allowing you to create multiple email aliases with different dot positions in the local part. It supports both "@gmail.com" and "@googlemail.com" domains and ensures that there are no consecutive dots in the generated aliases.

## Features

- Generate dot aliases for Gmail addresses.
- Supports both "@gmail.com" and "@googlemail.com" domains.
- Ensures no consecutive dots in the generated aliases.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter a Gmail address (without the "@ domain").
3. The script will generate dot aliases for both "@gmail.com" and "@googlemail.com" domains.
4. Copy and use the generated dot aliases as needed.

**Note:** If the input Gmail address does not have the "@gmail.com" or "@googlemail.com" suffix, the script will automatically add "@gmail.com" as the default domain.
